          "My love, distance may keep us apart physically,<br>
          but it can't diminish the beauty of our bond. 
          Like a rose, our love is vibrant, resilient, and endlessly enchanting. 
          Today, as the world celebrates roses, I celebrate you - the most precious flower in my life. 
          Each petal of this virtual rose represents the moments we've shared, each thorn a challenge we've overcome together. 
          Happy Rose Day, bubu jaan.Know that you're cherished, adored, and deeply loved. 
          Here's to the day we'll be together again, hand in hand, reveling in each other's presence."
